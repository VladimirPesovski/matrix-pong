# Pong Game Starter

A starter project for a basic pong game using SVGs. The base was pre-set so I add the functionality and the styling. The pre-set version was provided by RED Academy Toronto. My goal was to create an original theme with interesting sound effects and some extra features.

# Personal learnings:
The Matrix-Pong game was my first game ever made. The project it self coveres varieties of tasks such as: 
* Following instructions for proper pre-set.
* Creating vector objects
* Sourcing and implementing a theme background and sound effects.
* Using a terminal for all the operations and github uploads.

## Setup

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed first.

**Install dependencies:**

`$ npm install`

**Run locally with the Parcel dev server:**

`$ npm start`

Once you run the start command you can access your project at http://localhost:3000.

Read more about the [Parcel web application bundler here](https://parceljs.org/).

## Deploy

The deployment workflow for this project will be a bit different from what you've used when deploying simple static websites.

To deploy your finished Pong project as a GitHub page, you must first **update the `predeploy` script in the `package.json` file with the name of your repo.**



Technology used:
    HTML5 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
    CSS (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
    JavaScript (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)




For example, if your repo URL is:

https://github.com/bob/pong-project

Update the `predeploy` script as follows:

```json
"predeploy": "rm -rf dist && parcel build index.html --public-url /pong-project",
```

Once you have done this, you can run:

`$ npm run deploy`

Now check out your deployed site. For best experience, turn your speakers ON .. and loud !
